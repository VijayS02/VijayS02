- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Vijay
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in creating tech that can help people make their lives easier. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer science at the University of Toronto.

# My Repositories
Unfortunately a lot of my repositories may be private due to confidentiality with the clients that I work with. 
The published ones are just some fun I was having during courses/in my spare time. I don't really use github that much.

# Tensorflow
I am a verified tensorflow developer, my certificate can be found [here](https://www.credential.net/f728a966-7712-4c52-b9fd-218883cdc071).
